RADAR: A SDN-based Realtime Denial-of-Service Defense System
====================================

RADAR is a SDN-based Denial-of-Service defense system. It can detect and mitigate DDoS attack in realtime. We implement its prototype as a [Floodlight](http://www.projectfloodlight.org/floodlight/) [module](./src/main/java/net/floodlightcontroller/radar) which contains the main framework and 3 detection examples on [Crossfire](ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6547106/), SYN flooding and amplification attack.
